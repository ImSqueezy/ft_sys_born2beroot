`Lighttpd`, `MariaDB`, `WordPress`, and `FTP` are four software components that can be used together to create and run a web application or website.

As explained before, `Lighttpd` is a lightweight web server that can handle a large number of requests with minimal resource consumption, `MariaDB` is a relational database management system that provides the backend database storage for WordPress data, and `WordPress` is a content management system used to create and manage website content.

`FTP`, _or File Transfer Protocol_, is a network protocol used to transfer files between computers over the internet. It is often used to upload and manage website files and directories on a web server.

Together, these software components provide a complete solution for creating and managing a web application or website. Lighttpd handles incoming web requests, MariaDB provides the database storage for WordPress data, WordPress is used to create and manage website content, and FTP can be used to upload and manage website files and directories.
