### `SSH`

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure remote access to computers or servers. It provides a secure encrypted connection over an insecure network such as the Internet. SSH is commonly used by system administrators, programmers, and developers to securely access and manage remote servers or systems. It can also be used for file transfers and other network services.

### `OpenSSH`

OpenSSH is a powerful collection of tools for the remote control of, and transfer of data between, networked computers. You will also learn about some of the configuration settings possible with the OpenSSH server application and how to change them on your Ubuntu system.

OpenSSH is a freely available version of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol family of tools for remotely controlling, or transferring files between, computers. Traditional tools used to accomplish these functions, such as telnet or rcp, are insecure and transmit the userâ€™s password in cleartext when used. OpenSSH provides a server daemon and client tools to facilitate secure, encrypted remote control and file transfer operations, effectively replacing the legacy tools.

### `TCP/IP`

TCP is called as Transmission control protocol which provides a communication service between an application program and the Internet protocol (IP) A port is a number used to uniquely identify a transaction over a network by specifying both the host and the service. Port numbers range from 0 to 65535

SSH uses TCP/IP as its transport mechanism, usually TCP port 22 on the server machine, as it encrypts and decrypts the traffic passing over the connection.

### `SSH port 22`
The port is used for Secure Shell (SSH) communication and allows remote administration access to the VM. In general, traffic is encrypted using password authentication.

### What does ssh root do?
SSH Access To Root Account

SSH (Secure Shell) is often used for logging into remote servers as root. However, the default configuration in OpenSSH prevents root login using passwords.

### `UFW`
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly front-end for managing netfilter firewall rules in Linux operating systems. It is designed to make managing firewall rules easier for administrators who are not familiar with iptables syntax. With UFW, users can configure rules to allow or block traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
